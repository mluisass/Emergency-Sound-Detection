# Emergency Vehicle Sound Classifier

Project for Signals and Systems discipline that aims to detect sirens in traffic audio recordings. It includes feature extraction from audio signals, using techniques such as energy mean, zero crossing rate, and spectrogram mean. Two classification models, Random Forest and Gaussian Naive Bayes, are employed for siren detection. The models are evaluated using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation with 10 folds and calculating metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision.
